     that defines a group of objects known as elements. The Collection Interface is a part of java.util package.
     and it is a parent interface that is extended by other Collection interfaces like List , Set and Queue.
     The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface which allows the traversal of the Collection objects.

     the Collection Interface. These methods allow for basic operations such as adding, removing and checking the
     existence of elements in a Collection.
